# Telugu-Speech-Sentence-Modeling-For-Controlling-Smart-Devices

Speech recognition is fast growing and an active research field in which spoken words or sentences are processed to understand the meaning. It continues to this day as a major area of research having commercial importance as with a  number of applications. One of the significant applications is designing spoken dialog systems whose task is to interpret the message in the speech signal. Home appliance management is an interactive environment where there is a scope to develop speech interfaces for the operation of the appliances. Smart home control systems help disabled people to control their home electrical devices such as television(TV),  lights,  and fans using only voice commands without moving to turn on or turn off electrical equipment. Even though commercial systems are available, they are to be customized to suit the needs of a specific language. In this project the problem is handled in the context of the Telugu language. Since the dataset is not readily avialable, we prepared a sentence dataset for Telugu language for controling the IoT devices. Hidden Markov Modeling(HMM) with the use of different feature extraction techniques such as LPC, LPCC, and MFCC. In the study we find that MFCC features, work well comparitively for sentence modeling .The complete procedure of dataset collection, modeling, and evaluation are discussed in the report.
